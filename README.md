## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing sales data for a sports store to derive actionable insights into its operations. Using a single comprehensive table provided, the Power BI dashboard leverages a custom date table created in Power Query to enable time intelligence calculations, such as month-over-month (MoM) growth measures using DAX, build the data model by creating relationships between the date table and te sport table. The dashboard includes field parameters to dynamically switch metrics like sales, profit, and units sold by month. The background design was crafted in PowerPoint and imported into Power BI, enhancing visual appeal. Users can easily filter data by year and month to uncover trends and insights.

## Data Sources

## Data Cleaning/Preparation

- Loaded and inspected the single table to identify and correct errors.
- Standardized data formats and validated data integrity.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- What are the sales, profit, and unit sold trends by month?
- Which states contribute the most to sales?
- How do average unit price, profit, and sales vary by retailer?
- What are the top-performing product categories?
- How are sales distributed across different sales methods and cities?


##  The Power BI dashboard provides the following insights (based on May 2021 data):

- Sales Metrics (switchable via field parameters):
   - Total Sales: $6.36M (+33% MoM)
   - Units Sold: 178,900 (+11% MoM)
   - Profit: $2.41M (+32% MoM)
   - Profit Margin: 37.86% (-1% MoM)
   - Cost: $3.95M (-34% MoM)
   - Average Price: $45.11 (+18% MoM)

- Sales by State: Visualized on a map, showing concentration in the eastern U.S.
- Relationship between Avg Unit Price, Profit, and Sales by Retailer: Scatter plot comparing retailers like Walmart, Amazon, Foot Locker, etc.
- Sales by Month: Bar chart showing monthly trends for 2021, with dynamic MoM calculations.
- Products Performance: Table detailing sales, profit, and growth for categories like Men's Apparel and Women's Athletic Footwear.
- Sales by Sales Method: Pie chart showing distribution (e.g., Outlet: 28%, In-store: 37%, Online: 34%).
- Top 3 Cities by Sales: Los Angeles ($1.28M), Knoxville ($0.63M), Charleston ($0.34M).

## Recommendations


- Focus inventory and marketing on high-growth regions, especially the eastern U.S. states.
